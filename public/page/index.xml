&lt;h1 id=&#34;our-advantages:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;OUR ADVANTAGES&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;tallent:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;Tallent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to bringing together future leaders of China and the international
community, GCC-NUS concentrates specifically on the most talented and
motivated. As one of the best universities in Asia and in the world, NUS gathers
more than 30,000 top-notch students with 30% of them from outside Singapore.
Chinese students form a significant portion of the university’s international
population. With our unique focus on China, GCC-NUS can effectively reach out
to over 2,000 Chinese scholars in NUS, and to even more students from other
nationalities who also have an interest in the opportunities in and related to China.
GCC-NUS is also building its own alumni network where NUS alumni who are
keen on or have business interests in China will join the students to share their
knowledge and experiences. Backed by a strong and rigorous NUS community,
through our special positioning and careful selection, only highly motivated and
talented students will join our network. Every GCC-NUS member has the passion
and potential to make a profound impact on China and even on the world in the
foreseeable future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;experience:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;Experience&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many GCC-NUS members have first-hand experience living, studying, or working
in China. Their empirical understanding of China and their personal connections
with Chinese companies and professionals have enriched our network to an
even deeper and broader level. As an actual witness and practitioner in China’s
development and transformation, GCC-NUS is determined to introduce an
unabridged China to the world. We aim to share with our audience the most
genuine and useful knowledge of China, and to connect them to real opportunities
in China.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;global-outreach:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;Global Outreach&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of Global China Connection’s international network, we connect NUS to
prestigious universities across the globe. With chapters at more than sixty universities
across North America, Europe, and Asia, thousands of members and alumni, GCC
has become the world’s largest China-focused youth network. With such a strong
global outreach, GCC-NUS aims to connect NUS students with prospering youth
all over the world who have the same interest in China. Over the years, GCC has
established close ties with numerous professionals and experts in academia or their
respective industries. It has partnered with various institutions and corporations to
promote the common interest in China. Our location at NUS, Singapore also provides
us with abundant opportunities to link up with companies and organizations that have
a notable presence in China. With these connections GCC-NUS is well-equipped to
be a bridge connecting China and the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://gccnus.org/image/website+banner.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Website banner&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;benefits-to-partners-and-sponsors:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;BENEFITS TO PARTNERS AND SPONSORS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;investment-for-future:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;Investment for future&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We believe every reward in the future is seeded in the present. A relationship carefully cultivated
today can generate countless benefits tomorrow. A small gesture of help and a kind impression
left in the past could weigh much on impactful decision-makings in the years to come. Partnership
with and sponsorship for GCC-NUS are also an investment for the future. GCC-NUS is formed
of the most motivated and talented students who have the aptitude for becoming future leaders
in China and the international community. Any help or support from our partners and sponsors
will be largely appreciated by all GCC-NUS members, as it conveys an unforgettable message
of our partners’ and sponsors’ passion for connecting China to the world, their commitment to
developing the youth, their generosity, trust, and farsighted vision. Support for GCC-NUS today
will be further remunerated in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCC-NUS hopes to bring our partners and sponsors closer to our members. All partners and
sponsors will be invited to attend our major events where they get to know the students better and
communicate with them in person. Such personal exchanges build up a stronger rapport between
companies and students, and plant the roots for potential future cooperation. GCC-NUS has a
large talent pool of both Chinese and non-Chinese students. Besides their high calibre and keen
interest in China, they also possess an in-depth understanding of Chinese society, as well as a
strong international perspective. This highly targeted pool of talents will become a valuable asset
for both companies venturing into Chinese market and Chinese companies exploring overseas
opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;talent:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;Talent&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GCC-NUS members are from diverse backgrounds and disparate academic disciplines,
while many of them will soon graduate from university and start their own career path. We
are more than happy to help our partners organise campus networking or recruitment events
to match them with the best-fitted candidates. We can provide the care-free options and
help our partners manage every detail of the event, such as venue, sign-up, and schedule.
By collaborating with a NUS student organization, companies can reduce their recruitment
costs and minimise their efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;marketing:4aa91064829a87a923560cdfc3e29e1b&#34;&gt;MARKETING&lt;/h4&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ith fresh creativity and proficient command of different designing and marketing tools,
GCC-NUS continuously draws public attention and maintains a high profile. We have utilized
various marketing channels to publicize ourselves, ranging from poster design, video making,
to actively managing social media platforms like WeChat and Facebook. Our strong bilingual
ability enables us to reach different audience groups through marketing material made in
both Chinese and English. For companies that wish to establish a stronger presence among
students, we can leverage on our influence among NUS students to bring those companies
closer to the targeted audience. Through carefully designed marketing campaigns and publicity
events, we can create a positive marketing ripple effect to help companies eventually increase
awareness in the larger population.
For our annual flagship event, NUS China Summit, GCC-NUS will adopt a more holistic
marketing approach to reach out to the larger society. We will continue our active presence on
social media platforms, and deploy advertising material on both traditional and digital media.
Several media partners will be engaged to provide detailed coverage of NUS China Summit
to introduce our accomplishments to the whole society. Our partners and sponsors can be
assured that their contribution to the event will be made known to a much larger, yet similarly
focused audience group.&lt;/p&gt;
