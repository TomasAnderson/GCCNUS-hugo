title = "Trip to Hong Kong"

+++

Hong Kong has long been
China’s financial heart. It is home
to most international financial
institutions’ Asian headquarters. It
also provides funding for various
corporations and development
projects in Mainland China. This
winter trip will give NUS students
an opportunity to visit some
famous financial institutions’ Hong
Kong offices and to network with
professionals working there. We
are also planning on visiting a few
Hong Kong universities, hosted
by fellow GCC chapters at those
universities.
