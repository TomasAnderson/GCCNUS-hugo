NUS China Summit is our most
important annual event. Influential
panellists who are leaders in
their respective specialties and
industries, ranging from Culture/
Media, entrepreneurship, to
business and finance will be
invited to discuss on topics
related to China. We will also
organise a youth branch of this
Summit where students from
different backgrounds network and
exchange their own understanding
and experience with China.
